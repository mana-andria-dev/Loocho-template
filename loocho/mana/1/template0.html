	Your app is currently connected with a GitHub repository. 
You can however also edit the code on this online interface â€“ Loocho will automatically push the changes to GitHub and deploy them on the platform. 
Make sure that nobody is pushing changes to GitHub at the same time as you are making changes on this page, as Loocho cannot handle merge conflicts!
